## Challenges we ran into
One of the most significant hurdles we faced was solving the course selection algorithm to generate optimal schedules. Crafting an algorithm that could analyze the diverse preferences of individual users, while also factoring in their friends' preferences and various course offerings, proved to be extremely difficult. The challenge lay in the technical complexity and time efficiency of the algorithm.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're our hard work and persistence throughout tough problems.
